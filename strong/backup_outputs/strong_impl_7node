slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 69371228 ON lm3-w003 CANCELLED AT 2020-12-16T16:24:36 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[42237,0],0] on node lm3-w003
  Remote daemon: [[42237,0],6] on node lm3-w074

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
